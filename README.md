Adds compatibility for the **multishot** enchantment to the fishing rod, allowing it to shoot multiple bobbers at once.

To use the mod, use an anvil to combine multishot books up to level 10 and put it on a fishing rod. Then you may hold right click and watch as the loot rolls in. Compatible with enchantments, to remove bobbers simply switch off the item.
